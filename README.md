# Olympics Data Analysis and Visualization using Python
Hey there! I invite you to check out my website where I've conducted an extensive analysis of the Olympics history spanning 120 years.
I've gathered and examined essential biographical information and medal outcomes of athletes from the Athens 1896 to Rio 2016 games.

To showcase my findings, I've utilized various Python libraries such as Streamlit, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib pylpot, Scipy, Plotly Express and Figure_factory. 
These powerful tools enabled me to visualize and present the significant insights derived from the dataset in an engaging manner.

Feel free to visit my website and explore the intriguing world of Olympic data analysis and visualization!
